## No Kill Louisville Setup

We were able to meet with the President of NKL, and went over their current technology system. They currently use Excel to track the list of all clients they meet with and have information for. Each day NKL is open, they scan a QR code given to their clients, which adds them to a daily excel file with a link to the master excel to read their food and animal needs.

As well as that, they do not currently have an inventory system in place to track the amount of food they have. They store both wet and dry food, as well as variants for dog and cat size. They'd like to have some kind of way to track each food item recieved and mark what kind it is.

## Last Project and Current Ideas

Last year's group for NKL had a basic, but expandable local SQL lite database designed, however it was never implemented at NKL. Our current plan is to attempt to build both a daily log and an inventory tracker on top of the existing design, and install the application on NKL's current device with the assistance of their IT guy.

We also talked about the challenges with creating and building on top of legacy code, however decided to add onto it after investigating its source code. We'll also need to design a system to read QR codes and send them to our application, as well as printing information from our application as well.
